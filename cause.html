    <h1>Causes for overpopulation</h1>
    <div class="poverty">
    <h2>Poverty</h2>
    <h3>Poverty is believed to be the leading cause of overpopulation. A lack of <br>educational resources,
         coupled with high death rates leading to higher<br> birth rates, result in impoverished areas seeing large booms<br> in population.
         The effect is so extensive that the UN<br> has predicted that the forty-eight poorest countries in the world<br> are also likely to
         be the biggest contributors to population growth.<br> Their estimates state that the combined population of these countries <br>is
          likely to balloon to 1.7 billion in 2050, from 850 million in 2010.</h3>

        <h2>Immigration</h2>
        <h3>Unchecked immigrationinto countries may lead to overpopulation to the point<br>where those,
        countries no longer have the required resources for their population.<br> This particularly problematic
        in countries where immigration numbers far exceed<br> emigration numbers. In some cases, immigrants may
         be attempting to escape<br> overpopulation in thier own countries, only to contribute to the same issues in<br>
         in the countries they move to. However, data also exists to show the immigration<br> can bolster economies,
        with the effect in the UK being particularly pronounced.</h3>

        <h2>Child Labour</h2>
        <h3>As distressed as it may be hear, child labour is still used extensively in many<br> parts of the world.
            UNICEF estimates that approximately 150 million children<br> are currently working, primarily in countries
            that have few child labour laws.<br> This can result in children being seen as a source of income by impoverished <br>
            families. Furthermore, children who begin work too young also lose the <br> educational oppurtunities they should
            be granted, particularly when it <br>comes to birth control. It is one of the biggest causes of overpopulation. <h3>
