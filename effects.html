    <h1>Effects of overpopulation</h1>
    <div>
    <h2>Lower Life Expectancy</h2>
    <h3>While higher life expectancy is leading to increase in population in developed<br>
     countries, lower life expectancy maybe caused by the booms in population<br> that
     less developed nations are experiencing. A large proportion of the world's <br>population
     growth occurs in less developed countries. This stretches the resources <br>these countries
     have thinner resulting in less access to medical care, fresh water,<br> food and jobs, all
     resulting in a fall in life expectancy. National LEB figures reported<br>
     by national agencies and international organizations for human populations are<br>
     indeed estimates of period LEB. Life expectancy is also used in plant or animal <br>ecology
     and in life tables(also known as actuarial tables).</h3>

    <h2>Resource Consumption</h2>
    <h3>As the population grows, so too does the amount of resources needed to keep<br>
        so many people alive. Food, water and fossil fuels are all being consumed ar <br>
        record rates, placing greayer demands on producers amd the planet itself.<br>
        Ironically, it is the discovery of many of these natural resources - particularly<br>
        fossil fuels that have contributed to conditions that are favourable to population <br>
        growth. A study has shown that the world's ecosystem changed more rapidly in the <br>
        latter-half of the 20th century than at any other point in history because of <br>
        increased use of these resources. Hence, its a major effect of overpopulation. </h3>

    <h2>Faster Climate Change</h2>
    <h3>Overpopulation directly correlates to climate change, particularly as larger<br>
        nations, like China and India, continue to develop their industrial capacities. <br>
        They now rank as two of the three largest contributors in the world alongside<br>
        The United States. 97% of the scientific community agrees that human activity <br>
        are changed global temperatures. Larger populations may speed these changes <br>
        up, especially if more is not done to reduce individuals carbon footprints on a <br>
        wide scale basis. Earth's climate is now changing than at any point in the history <br>
        of modern civilization, primarily as a result of human activities. </h3>
