    <h1>Solutions for overpopulation</h1>
    <div>
        <h2>Better Education</h2>
        <h3>One of the first measures is to implement policies reflecting social change.<br>
            Educating the masses helps them understand the need to have one or two<br>
            or two children at most. Similarly, education plays a vital role in understanding <br>
            the latest technologies that are making a huge waves in the world of computing.<br>
            Families that are facing a hard life and choose to have four or five children <br>
            should be discouraged. Open dialogue on abortion and voluntary sterlization <br>
            should be seen when talking about overpopulation. A more educated workforce<br>
            also makes poverty eradication and economic growth easier to achieve.</h3>

    <h2>Tax Benefits</h2>
    <h3>The government of various countries might have to come up with various <br>
        policies relate to tax exemptions to curb overpopulation. One of them <br>
        might be to wave a certain part of income tax or lowering rates of income<br>
        tax or lowering rates of income tax for those married couples wo have single<br>
        or two children. As we humans are more inclined towards money, this may <br>
        produce some positive results. A tax benefit comes in different forms, such<br>
        as a deduction, exclusion or credit. The amount of tax you can save also <br>
        depends on the type of tax benefit you claim because they each offer a <br>
        a different form of savings.   </h3>

    <h2>Social Marketing</h2>
    <h3>Social marketing has alreday been started by some socities to educate the <br>
        public on overpopulation effects. The intervention can be made widespread <br>
        at a low cost. A variety of print materials(flyers, brochures, fact sheets,<br>
        stickers) an be distributed in places such as local places of worship,<br>
        sporting events, local food markets, schools and at car parks. Traditional<br>
        commercial marketing aims are primarily financial, though they can have <br>
        positive social effects as well. In the context of public health, raise<br>
        awareness and induce changes in behaviour. Hence, this an effective solution.</h3>
